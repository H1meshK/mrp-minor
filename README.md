# Web-Based MRP System for Inventory & Production Planning

A web-based **Material Requirements Planning (MRP)** system designed to streamline **inventory control, BOM management, and production scheduling** for small-to-medium manufacturing environments. The system emphasizes **operational simplicity, real-time visibility, and decision support**, avoiding the complexity of traditional ERP solutions.

## 📌 Project Overview

Manufacturing units often rely on spreadsheets or manual records for inventory and production planning, which leads to material shortages, overstocking, and scheduling delays.  
This project provides a **centralized MRP platform** integrating inventory, BOM, and production planning into a single workflow.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate inventory tracking and material availability checks  
- Enable BOM-based material requirement planning  
- Support structured production scheduling  
- Reduce manual planning errors and spreadsheet dependency  
- Improve coordination between inventory and production teams  


## ⚙️ Key Features

### Inventory Management
- Real-time stock level tracking  
- Material issue and receipt updates  
- Visibility of available vs required inventory  

### Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Structured BOM creation for finished goods  
- Automatic material requirement calculation  

### Production Planning
- Gantt chart–based production scheduling  
- Material availability validation before order release  
- Data cards for tracking production status  

### Reports & Analytics
- Inventory status reports  
- Production plans and schedules  
- BOM summaries for operational review  

## 🏭 Example Manufacturing Workflow

1. Planner reviews dashboard and identifies low-stock materials  
2. Inventory is updated after material receipt or consumption  
3. BOM is generated for a new production order  
4. Production schedule is created using Gantt charts  
5. Reports are generated for coordination and decision-making  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Architecture:** MERN-based structure focused on core MRP logic  
- **Visualization:** Gantt charts, data cards, operational reports  


## 📊 Outcomes & Impact

- Improved visibility into inventory and material requirements  
- Reduced material shortages and excess inventory  
- Production planning aligned with material availability  
- Faster, data-driven operational decision-making  


## 👨‍🎓 Academic Context

- **Project Type:** Minor Project  
- **Discipline:** Industrial & Production Engineering  
- **Focus Areas:**  
  - Production Planning & Control (PPC)
